# ChromSpec
This project explores using multivariate logistic regression for multi-label classification of unknown compounds using GCMS mass spectra data and an in-house collected library which was used to train the logistic model. 

Main parts of the code include:
1. Preprocessing of data
2. Feature engineering of data
3. Modelling using logistic regression

Features include:
1. Creating a new model from data
2. Using an existing trained model
3. Adding more data to existing models 

Disclaimer: In-house data was removed entirely and compound names replaced with arbitary names to ensure privacy of contents.

An example of the generated report can be seen below where each compound's models will give a probability of their respective compound existing in the sample:
