# ChromSpec
This project explores using multivariate logistic regression for multi-label classification of unknown compounds using GCMS mass spectra data and an in-house collected library which was used to train the logistic model. 

Disclaimer: In-house data was removed entirely and compound names replaced with arbitary names to ensure privacy of contents.

An example of the generated can be seen below:
